# IF_The_Else
Interactive Fiction Game in C

This is a very classic-style interactive fiction game, it's pure text.

Anytime you see something in the text that is all caps, this implies it is something you can interact with.
A couple of examples:

There is a PAINTING on the wall.

Then you can enter an action such as: check/examine/etc. painting

Another:

You see a ROCK on the ground.

Then action: get/take/grab/etc. rock

This is just the tip of the iceberg for the action options you have. In certain places you may be able to try different things, just use some logic, and don't be afraid to think outside the box.

Finally, if you find yourself in an area where there are ridiculous puzzles and weird things going on, congratulations, you are in the final area.
Good luck! -stringzzz

P.S. There are several obscure easter eggs in the game, have fun finding them! :P
